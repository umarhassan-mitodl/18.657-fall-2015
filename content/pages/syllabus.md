## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

[*18.100C Real Analysis*](/courses/18-100c-real-analysis-fall-2012)

[*18.06SC Linear Algebra*](/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011)

[*18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics*](/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014)

## Description

Broadly speaking, Machine Learning refers to the automated identification of patterns in data. As such it has been a fertile ground for new statistical and algorithmic developments. The purpose of this course is to provide a mathematically rigorous introduction to these developments with emphasis on methods and their analysis.

## The Topics Covered

The class will be split in three main parts:

1. The Statistical Theory of Machine Learning.
    - Classification, Regression, Aggregation
    - Empirical Risk Minimization, Regularization
    - Suprema of Empirical Processes
2. Algorithms and Convexity.
    - Boosting
    - Kernel Methods
    - Convex Optimization
3. Online Learning.
    - Online Convex Optimization
    - Partial Information: Bandit Problems
    - Blackwell's Approachability

1. Homework 40%   
      
    There are 3 homework assignments.
2. Final project 50%   
      
    The final project should be in any area related to one of the topics of the course or use tools that are developed in class. Examples include: implementing an algorithm for real data, extend an existing method or prove a theoretical result (or a combination of these). You will need to submit a written report (~10 pages) and give a presentation in class in the last week of semester (the duration will depend on the size of the class).
3. Lecture notes scribing 10%
